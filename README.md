This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to late binding and provides a solution. Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to runtime errors if not handled carefully. The example showcases how referencing a non-existent object or method results in a runtime failure. The solution illustrates two approaches: early binding for improved type safety and a runtime check to ensure the object exists before accessing its methods.
